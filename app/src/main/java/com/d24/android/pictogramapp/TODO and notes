*** Scenes

1. [99%] Add - editingFragment list
2. [99%] Add several editingFragments
3. [99%] Navigate fragments (swipe)
4. [99%] Navigate properly (they are removed)
5. [99%] Add scenes properly
    * [FIXED] When attempting to add NEW scenes while at Fragment nr (x > 0). Something funky happens with "setPrimaryItem".
        * [FIXED]  It seems to ADD two views ontop of eachother, (however it can be 'worked around', by adding new scenes while at Fragment nr. 0)?
6. [50%] Delete scenes
    * Removing BEFORE last scene. "Moves" [to be deleted scene] on top of the previous Scene.
        * When navigating PAST "the double scene" on the left. and back towards the right. The [deleted scene] jumps to the right
    * Trying to fix by destroyItem.super();
    * Progress

7. If fragment is "NOT ATTACHED". The fragmentManager has not added the fragment to transaction.add(frag); transaction.commit();
    Find where it's been done


The problem lies here!
 mFragments.get(position) is not null! (it should be after we deleted it)

    @Override
    public Object instantiateItem(ViewGroup container, int position) {
        // If we already have this item instantiated, there is nothing
        // to do.  This can happen when we are restoring the entire pager
        // from its saved state, where the fragment manager has already
        // taken care of restoring the fragments we previously had instantiated.
        if (mFragments.size() > position) {
            Fragment f = mFragments.get(position);
            if (f != null) {
                return f;
            }
        }

        if (mCurTransaction == null) {
            mCurTransaction = mFragmentManager.beginTransaction();
        }

        Fragment fragment = getItem(position);
        if (DEBUG) Log.v(TAG, "Adding item #" + position + ": f=" + fragment);
        if (mSavedState.size() > position) {
            Fragment.SavedState fss = mSavedState.get(position);
            if (fss != null) {
                fragment.setInitialSavedState(fss);
            }
        }
        while (mFragments.size() <= position) {
            mFragments.add(null);
        }
        fragment.setMenuVisibility(false);
        fragment.setUserVisibleHint(false);
        mFragments.set(position, fragment);
        mCurTransaction.add(container.getId(), fragment);

        return fragment;
    }
